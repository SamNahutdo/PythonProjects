***Top Python Commands List With Examples***

Python programming language is an interpretable general-purpose high-level language. Its syntax is simple to understand and beginner-friendly. Thus, the majority of experts advise newbies to learn Python as their first programming language. In this post, we will talk about the top Python commands list with examples to help you learn the language faster.

The term "commands" in the Python programming language refers to various functions or methods that can be used as commands by being executed on the Python shell. The Python official documentation claims that there are no "commands" in Python, only various types of functions, such as input(), type(), len(), and so on. Enhance your coding journey and bookmark this guide for quick access to the essential list of all Python commands.

Python Command Introduction
High-level, interpreted, and object-oriented Programming Languages like Python are well-known. It was created by Guido van Rossum. Python is a portable, scripting, extensible, scalable, and GUI programming language that is simple to learn and use. In addition to offering high-level dynamic type and dynamic type verification, it allows automatic garbage collection. Python offers a collection of commands that are used while programming the same thing. Here is a basic list of commands in Python and their concepts to get you started:

Basic Python Commands List
1. pip install command

Python was used to create the package manager known as pip. It is used to organize and install software packages. The Python Package Index is an online repository of open-source software packages that may be installed using the pip install command. Open Windows PowerShell before using the following syntax to install any package to run this command in Windows.

Syntax: pip install package-name

2. type command

To determine an object's type or class, use the type command.

syntax: type(object)

3. print command

To display a message on the screen or another standard output device, use the print command. Any object, including a string, can serve as a message. Any sort of object, including an integer, a string, a list, a tuple, etc., can be printed with the print command.

syntax: print(object)
4. range command

When n is not included in the generated numbers, the range command is used to generate a sequence of integers starting by default at 0 and going up to n. This command is primarily used for loops.

Syntax: range(start, stop, step)

start: is the starting range. Optional; 0 by default.
stop: is the number before which you want to stop. It is a Mandatory.
step: the increment count. Optional; 1 by default.

5. input command

The input command collects user input. Until a value has been input by the user, the program will not continue. The input function will translate whatever the user types into a string. You must explicitly convert an integer if you want to use it as input.

Syntax: input(message)

The message is the text you need to display to the user. (Optional)

6. round command

This command rounds a number to a particular number of decimal digits. In other words, if a float point value has a certain number of digits after the decimal, you can use the round command to round off the desired number. You can specify the desired number of digits after the decimal.

Syntax: round(number, digits)

number: it is the floating-point number.
digits: it is the count of digits you want after the decimal point. (Optional; By default 0)
7. len command

To determine how many elements are contained in an object, use the len command or len() function. The len() function returns the number of characters in the object if it is a string. The number of elements in the list or tuple, if the object is one of them, will be returned. If you attempt to send an integer value to len(), it returns an error.

Syntax: len(object)

object: it is the object of which you want to determine the length (Required)
8. Loop commands

The two basic loop statements in Python are while and for. While the specified condition is true, a series of statements are carried out using the while loop command.

Syntax of while loop: while condition:

statements
update iterator
9. for loop command 

The for loop command is used to repeatedly run a sequence of statements. This list, tuple, string, dictionary, etc., can be used as the sequence.

Syntax: for x in sequence:

statements
Python Intermediate Commands
Certainly, here are some intermediate-level Python commands list and concept that build upon the basics:

String Commands

There are many string commands available in the Python programming language that can be applied to string objects. These commands merely return a new object; they do not alter the original string object. The following are some of the crucial string functions:

1. isalnum(): It determines whether a given string contains alphanumeric characters or not. It gives back a boolean result.

Syntax: stringname.isalnum()

2. capitalize(): If the initial character of the string is lowercase, the capitalize() method converts it to uppercase. Nothing happens if the initial character is uppercase, an integer, or any other special character.

Syntax: stringname.capitalize()

3. find(): To find a substring within a string, use the find() command. If the substring is present, it provides the index of the first instance; if not, it returns -1.

Syntax: string.find(substring)

string: it is the string in which you want to search.
substring: it is the value that you want to search for.
4. center(): The center command centers a string by using a specified character as the fill character (by default, a space).

Syntax: string.center(length, character)

string: the string that you want to align in the center.
length: the full length taken by the new string in which both sides will be filled by character and in the center, we will have the original string.
character: the character is useful in filling the missing space on every side.
Default: it is ” ” (space).
Python Commands: Tips and Tricks
Use the built-in Python method for lists called data typeset.
The item can be iterated using the enumerate function.
Adaptive typing is used.
Compare the values using operators.
Make use of conditional phrases for better outcomes.
Make the programs distinct and reusable by using modules.
